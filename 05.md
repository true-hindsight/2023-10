## Industry-wide, Ongoing Medical Malpractice and Malfeasance

Keywords: State-sponsored abuse, conservatorship, healthcare laws, California, Care Court.

The following links showcase some of the ways in which medical sciences like psychiatry have been, or are being misused and abused in North America. Such articles are to be considered in light of new upcoming laws impacting personal rights and freedoms, due to the implementation of a "Care Court" in places like California, USA.

Psychiatrists who are given a weekly quota to eliminate misfits, or to "keep 'undesirables' off the streets", are also given complete indemnity and wide leeway by authorizing agencies, for certifying targeted individuals as, 

>"medically unfit, or incompetent, to make any legal, financial, and healthcare related decisions via individual rights to self-determination and consent based professional services." 

Systematized human rights abuses using coordinated policing actions and punitive medicine, are still being committed by cultural police masquerading as psychiatric doctors, in Ontario, Canada. The state-sponsored apparatus for committing those abuses include legalized methods for causing targeted persons to be forcibly turned into "a ward of the state", via "conservatorship" in a healthcare facility, using false pretexts, deceptions, wrongful medical treatments, socio-economic deprivation, and police harassment; all of which directly cause traumatic mental health problems to arise among targeted people. Those captive persons are then further subjected to punitive medicine with different forms of torment, torture, and pernicious harms inflicted upon them, to permanently subdue or eliminate "unwanted denizens" in a stealthy way.  

The insidiousness of those forms of systematized harms committed against targeted groups and individuals, dates back to the work carried out by [Donald E. Cameroon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Ewen_Cameron) from 1952 onward. Donald Cameroon's research and development work in psychology and psychiatry, was a direct continuation of heinous experiments conducted on captive human beings by German Nazi and Japanese biological warfare scientists during World War II. 

The reason I know details about which biochemical and radiological molecules impact different forms of neuro-endocrine pathways, has to do with an American military-sponsored project in the year 2009, that I was supposed to work on, for creating sets of "enhanced interrogation techniques." After reading the specifications of that project, I had quit going to the University of Iowa lab where I used to work, during the spring of that year. Subsequently I was fired from that lab in June-2009.

Giving pilots, security agents, and soldiers tailored psychotropic drugs to tune their daily routines, behaviors, implicit trust in their handlers, and pliability towards given orders, has been a standard practice in various military cadres of the US, Canada, Australia, and the UK, since decades. Upon being discharged from military, para-military, or intelligence services, veteran personnel naturally develop withdrawal symptoms when they are cut off from the drugs they used to be routinely administered during missions; following which, many of them take to self-medication via street drugs or illegitimately obtained prescription medications. Unsurprisingly, a large number of homeless people with addictions and physiological challenges, within Canada and the US, happen to be military service veterans. This has long been a public healthcare policy based crisis in places like Southern California, USA, and Kitchener, Canada. Of course, that crisis only became worse with the flood of opioids in North America. 

Worst of all, university schools and colleges along with their accreditation institutes in-charge of training and licensing medical professionals, particularly ones dealing with psychology and psychiatry within North American healthcare systems, still do not emphasize using diagnostic techniques necessary for investigating physiological functions of lymphatic, digestive, and neuro-endocrine systems of the human body, before prescribing a pharmacological or an electro-mechanical intervention using trial-and-error based methods for "mental health issues." The emphasis is instead laid on processing more number of people quickly based on cursory visual inspection of the persons behavior and at most, a 5 to 10 minute interview with person needing healthcare support. 

For example, patients who only needed to be prescribed a proton-pump inhibitor for acid reflux issues, need not have been given benzodiazpines for symptoms of, "constant unease and queasiness in the lower chest area that happens to 'feel like' â€” inexplicable, general anxiety." 

As an example, from your experience, and in your own opinion, how many licensed physicians, and psychiatrists in countries like the US, the UK, and Canada would ever bother to adopt physiologically informative labels like "Nor-epinephrine Deficiency", regarding causal factors impacting [dopinergic pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopaminergic_pathways) in the human nervous system, instead of using less informative labels like "Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)?" 

Would you agree that, if, a medical condition were to be correctly and precisely diagnosed as Nor-epinephrine Deficiency, its treatment could be more specific, obvious, comprehensible to the patient, and free of stigma, compared to the patient's medical condition being diagnosed using a vague label like ADHD? 

Also, the term ADHD encompasses a drastically wide range of symptoms that happen to overlap with the symptoms of many other different medical conditions. Those so-called symptoms are almost always, subjectively recorded by an attending physician or a psycho-therapist as a characteristic indicator of a somewhat arbitrarily chosen label for mental health issues, and too often, without applying any physiology based tests investigating the person's anatomical and physiological healthcare challenges.  

Therefore, improvements in people's quality of life cannot be achieved via psychiatric treatments that do not have a proper grounding within physiological sciences and biochemistry; especially not by using the ongoing hodge-podge within medical diagnostics and pharmacological prescriptions being doled out by physicians in the healthcare industry.
