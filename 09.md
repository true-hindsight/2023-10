## How Canada's Authority Figures are Despoiling the World's Peace

It turns out that no one is talking about the illegality and illegitimacy of how Indian diplomats in Canada were being spied upon, which supposedly, yielded "credible 'evidence'" of a connection between the activities of those diplomats, and the eventual killing of a Kalsa Movement operative incubated in Canada. 

As I happen to be *no_one,* I am required to comment on this - https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/4/is-canada-trying-to-mollify-india-after-hardeep-singh-nijjar-killing 

>There has not been even a shred of evidence available in any conceivable corridor or avenue, that would truthfully link Indian government activities with the killing of any person in Canada. 

Any and all interpretation of "signals" obtained via any legal or illegal means, by agencies that Justin Trudeau's administration has been relying upon for putting forth his allegations against the Indian Government, are entirely fabricated concoctions. Justin Trudeau's inklings and his officers' doubts or misgivings, cannot be accepted as a measured standard of "discernible truth." Those types of wrongful activities of Canadian officials, cannot be excused at this point in time as "a set of misunderstandings and misjudgments on part of the Canadian Federal Government, based on the way surveillance data was obtained by its responsible officers and ministers." 

What has instead come to light is that, supposed allies of India, have continuously spied on diplomats from the Republic of India as well as on those from other countries, within and outside North America, in a blatant breach of trust and confidentiality. Such bad-faith activities committed by those bad-actors, cannot be justified as "appropriate levels of vigilance based on a right to self-preservation." There were no credible reasons what-so-ever, for why any of those diplomats and embassy staffers had to be monitored using invasive and surreptitious methods, by Canada and its supporting intelligence groups. 

Most importantly, the concept of "International, Rules-Based Order" cannot work, nor can it be legitimized, if even ratified rules are simply ignored by the US, Canada, the UK, the EU, and Australia, once those binding rules and accepted treaties are implemented by signatory nations and countries of the world, with the sincere intent for being adhered to, as an obligation. 

The accepted rules about the penalties and punishments for a breach of trust and confidentiality in such serious matters, are clear and unambiguous. There is absolutely no reason why any country ought to tolerate the type of hypocrisy and treachery demonstrated by Canadian officials in knowingly committing highly invasive activities, borne out of bad-faith and discriminatory prejudice. Those types of wrongful activities have only continued to despoil the very basis of diplomacy and good-faith relationships, throughout the modern world. 

Those who pledge that "In God we trust", and thereafter, constantly say that they need to 'test and verify' the activities of the one they have already put their trust in, using forceful or cunning methods, only tend to do so by positioning themselves above and beyond God. So, what reasons can possibly exist, to forgive those types of hypocritical, wretched and unrepentant persons? Nothing else is in store for those wrongdoers, other than for them to receive the condemnations that they have earned, in complete regulatory thoroughness and without any further delays.
